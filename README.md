# vanillamultiboxer
A hobby-level project I decided to take up because I couldn't find a multiboxing program for WoW 1.12.1 that I liked.
Basic multiboxer with simple blacklisting/memory reading capabilities.

# How it works
- Sends WINAPI messages to all wow clients
- Requires you to select a client that you will be playing on (the Master Client)
- Will not send keystrokes to the Master

# Features
- Basic blacklisting/whitelisting capabilities
- Basic memory reading capabilities
